# Reggies-Linear-Regression-Project
This project aims to implement a version of linear regression in Python to help Reggie, a mad scientist hired by a local fast food joint, optimize the bounciness of different balls in their newest ball pit. Reggie is running an experiment to bounce different sizes of bouncy balls and fit lines to the recorded data points. Linear regression will allow him to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the error between the observed data points and the line.
